## stats. agg.

## code 1:

### median values without precentile function
select *  from (select o_totalprice, row_number() over (order by o_totalprice) as r from orders) s where r between  1500/2 and 1500/2+1;

### median value of total price of each customer
select o_custkey, percentile_disc(0.5) within group (order by o_totalprice) from orders group by o_custkey;

### sum per year and month
select year, month,  sum(o_totalprice) from(select extract(year from o_orderdate) as year, extract(month from o_orderdate) as month, o_totalprice from orders) s group by rollup(year, month) order by year, month; 

## Slide 36

select n_name, r_name, sum(o_totalprice) from customer, orders, nation, region where o_custkey = c_custkey and c_nationkey = n_nationkey and n_regionkey = r_regionkey group by rollup(r_name, n_name) order by r_name, n_name;
